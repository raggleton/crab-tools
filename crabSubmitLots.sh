# Allows CRAB to submit more than 500 jobs 

# Usage: crabSubmitLots.sh <JOB FOLDER>
# e.g. crabSubmitLots.sh SignalM125_POWHEG
# This script will then submit all jobs for that dataset, even if > 500


#Â OLD:
# Usage: crabSubmitLots.sh <OPT> <JOB FOLDER> <JOB NUMBERS>
# -R option for resubmission instead of submission, *BUT IS BROKEN*
# only job folder argument is mandatory

# To find out how many jobs there are
# look in <JOB>/share/arguments.xml
# Or see how many the user has specified
